Task1:
On static List<String> changeList(List<String> list) method you must do:
find the longest string in list
-if you use method max of class Collections : don't forget to implement a comparator for this method
Collections.max(list, (s1,s2)->{...})
by default, this method compares strings alphabetically!
-of course you can use other approaches(for example comparison in a for-loop)
replace all list items with this row
return modified list
Sample Input:
hi hello goodmorning ass

Sample Output:
goodmorning
goodmorning
goodmorning
goodmorning

Task2:

Sooo this task may seem difficult , but actually it is not ! some after it become man...)
your BufferedReader gets string as this : "1 2 3 4 5"

next, you must create a list of numbers from this line(ArrayList<Integer>) in the createBigList:
*String[] strarr = str.split(" "); - String element from given string ( "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
*In for-each loop convert to Integer and add all alements from strarr to bigList
â€ƒ-->Use Integer.parseInt(s) or Integer.valueOf(s) to convert from String to Integer
*return this bigList

have created three list, add the desired items in each and sort this lists in ascending order:
div2List for integers that x%2=0 {2, 4}
div3List for integers that x%3=0 {3}
otherlist for the remaining integers {1, 5}
if x%2=0 and x%3=0 add x to div2List and div3List!
Sort all three lists and create List of this three lists where the first element is div2List, second -  div3List and third - otherlist.
*method printInLine(resultList) is already written by me
*you can use all from java.util.*( including
java.util.stream.*)
*don't forget class
Collections(many useful methods on collections)

Task3:

Given string as this "1 2 3 4 5....". reader read this string.
1.Separate elements with a space from str;
2.add all this numbers to head of Linkedlist;
3.remove 3 times the element at index 0;
4.sort the resulting list in ascending order and print all of its elements each on a new line;
